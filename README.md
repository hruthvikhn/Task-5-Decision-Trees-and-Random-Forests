# Task 5: Decision Tree and Random Forest – Breast Cancer Dataset

Hi!! This repository contains my implementation of classification using Decision Tree and Random Forest models, applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  
The goal was to train, evaluate, and compare tree-based models for predicting whether a tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).

## What This Task Covers

- Import and preprocess the dataset  
- Encode target variable (M=1, B=0)  
- Remove unnecessary columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`)  
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier with default parameters  
- Limit Decision Tree depth to reduce overfitting  
- Train a Random Forest Classifier and compare performance  
- Visualize the first few levels of the Decision Tree  
- Plot feature importances from the Random Forest model  
- Evaluate both models with:
  - Accuracy score
  - Classification report
  - Confusion matrix
  - Cross-validation

## Key Learnings

- How decision trees work for classification tasks  
- The concept of overfitting and how limiting tree depth can help  
- How Random Forests reduce variance and improve accuracy  
- How to interpret feature importance in ensemble models  
- The use of cross-validation to get a more reliable performance estimate

## Tools Used (Kaggle, Google Colab)

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, metrics)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for plotting
